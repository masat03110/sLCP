# PDB File Examples for Algorithm Testing

This directory contains a small collection of **original and trimmed PDB files**, used for developing and testing structural bioinformatics algorithms.  
Each `*_trimmed.pdb` file is a simplified version of its corresponding original structure, retaining only selected atoms or models.

## üìÅ File Structure

```
samples/
    1pyv.pdb # Original structure from RCSB PDB
    1pyv_trimmed.pdb # Partial version (first 10 C-alpha atoms)
    7my8.pdb # Original structure from RCSB PDB
    7my8_trimmed.pdb # Partial version (first 10 C-alpha atoms)
```
